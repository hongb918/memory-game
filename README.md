MEMORY GAME

For this project, I am re-creating a memory game. he game follow a traditional memory game. The objective is to match every pairs on the board. The game is finished when the player find all matching pairs. 

In this repo, I build a focus around array methods, and setting Attributes in Javascript. 

APPLICATIONS & APPROACHES:
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVSCRIPT
    . createElement
    . document.querySelector
    . dataset
    . appendChild
    . addEventListener
    . for Loops
- All images are found through Canva website.


UNSOLVED PROBLEMS & MAJOR HURDLES:
- Adding in timer and reset button for the game
- One major hurdle was finding ways to transition the cards into an array.
